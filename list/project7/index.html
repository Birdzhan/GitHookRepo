In respect of each customer an individual approach against his own nature, requirements and needs. For the first time in the country Gallery for massage Body in Balance took the initiative in organizing and conducting Panchakarma program - a holistic medical system whose main goal is to achieve a balance between the body, emotions and soul, in the pursuit of every person to health, happiness and creative growth.
			 Why exactly "Body in Balance"? Where this name comes from, what it means and why is called with this unpopular name?
			Indian legend relates many stories about Lord Shiva, also known as "Balance". He is famous for being the embodiment of the power of destruction in an eternal cycle of creation maintenance, and destruction. Shiva is also associated with deep states of meditation where  thoughts are absent and only silence and emptiness exist. It is said that Lord Shiva once entered a profound state of meditation for the benefit of mankind for a very long time. When the finally emerged from this state and opened his eyes, the deep joy, peace, and love he felt for the human race was expressed with sacred tears which run down his cheek and fell to earth. Each tear generated a rudraksha tree whose tiny fruits are born of the tears of rudra - the Lord Almighty Himself. 
			The word rudraksha, in fact, comes from the two Sanskrit words rudra, a synonym for Lord Shiva, and alalia, meaning "eyes". Botanically, the rudraksha tree is known as Elaecarpus ganilrus Roxb. These trees are growing in very few places in the world including the Himalayas oj India and Nepal* as well as in parts of Indonesia. They arc large trees with a wide silhouette whoseflowers bloom annually. The rudraksha berry varies in size (3-40 mm). It has smooth light green skin and pulp much like a green grape. Lodged within the pulp is a single round seed which has a rough surface. It is these seeds which are the rudraksha beads. Each seed also possesses from I to 21 vertical lines running down its surface, like tfle longitude lines on a globe. These lines are known as mukhas, or facets, and are natural formations of the seed. Seeds with one vertical line are known as ek-mukhi (one facet): those with two lines are dwi-mukshi (two facets), and so on.
