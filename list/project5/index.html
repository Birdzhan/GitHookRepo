						<p>
							Football refers to a number of sports that involve, to varying degrees, 
							kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. The most popular of these sports 
							worldwide is association football, more commonly known as just "football" or 
							"soccer". Unqualified, the word football applies to whichever form of football 
							is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears, including 
							association football, as well as American football, Australian rules football, 
							Canadian football, Gaelic football, rugby league, rugby union, and other 
							related games. These variations of football are known as football codes.

						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)">The Laws of the Game</a> 
						are the codified rules that help define association football. 
						They are the only rules of association football subscribed to by the sport's governing 
						body FIFA. The laws mention the number of players a team should have, the game length, 
						the size of the field and ball, the type and nature of fouls that referees may penalize, 
						the frequently misinterpreted offside law, and many other laws that define the sport. 
						During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the Game.

						<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_pitch">Soccer Field</a></h3>
						<p>
							A football pitch (also known as a football field or soccer field) is the playing surface for 
							the game of football made of turf. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of 
							the Game, "The Field of Play".
							All line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on or above the 
							touchline is still on the field of play; a ball on the line of the goal area is in the goal area; and a foul 
							committed over the <abbr title="18-yard">16.5-metre</abbr> line has occurred in the penalty area. Therefore a ball 
							must completely cross the touchline to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line
							(between the goal posts) before a goal is scored; if any part of the ball is still on or above the line, 
							the ball is still in play. 
						</p> <!--Added abbreviation to 16.5-metre-->
